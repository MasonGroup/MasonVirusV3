## Overview

The **MasonVirusV3** is a malicious program created by a developer known as **ChatGPT**. This virus is designed to cause severe disruption and chaos on the victim's computer, including overwriting the Master Boot Record (MBR), rendering the system unbootable, and creating visual disturbances on the screen. The combination of these effects makes this virus particularly destructive and terrifying.

## What It Does

When executed, the virus performs the following actions:

1. **MBR Overwrite**: The virus overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the system with random data. This action makes the computer unbootable, forcing the victim to reinstall the operating system. 💀
2. **Screen Distortion**: It uses the `PatBlt` function to invert the colors of the entire screen at random intervals, creating a glitchy, flickering effect. 🎨
3. **Randomized Colors**: The virus randomly generates RGB color values and applies them to the screen, making the visual effect unpredictable. 🌈
4. **Simulated Typing**: Random characters are typed on the screen, creating a chaotic and eerie environment. 🖋️
5. **Mouse Movement**: The virus randomly moves the mouse pointer across the screen, further disorienting the user. 🖱️
6. **Disable Task Manager**: It prevents the user from accessing Task Manager, making it harder to terminate the program. 🚫
7. **Infinite Loop**: The program runs in an infinite loop, causing continuous disruptions and making it nearly impossible for the user to regain control. 🔁

This virus runs silently in the background, causing significant damage to the system and creating a terrifying user experience.

## Technical Details

The virus is built using C++ and leverages several Windows API functions, including:

- **`GetDesktopWindow`**: Retrieves a handle to the desktop window. 🖥️
- **`GetWindowDC`**: Retrieves the device context (DC) for the desktop window. 🖱️
- **`ReleaseDC`**: Releases the device context after use. 🔄
- **`GetSystemMetrics`**: Retrieves screen width and height for the current display. 📏
- **`CreateSolidBrush`**: Creates a solid brush with a random color. 🖌️
- **`SelectObject`**: Selects the brush into the device context. 🎨
- **`PatBlt`**: Performs a bit-block transfer (used here for inverting the screen colors). 🔲
- **`WriteFile`**: Used to overwrite the MBR with random data, making the system unbootable. 💾

The combination of these actions results in a chaotic and destructive effect, leaving the victim with a non-functional system and an unsettling experience.

## How to Compile

To compile this program, use a C++ compiler such as Visual Studio. Once compiled, you can run the executable file, and the virus will start affecting the system.

### Steps:
1. Open the code in Visual Studio or another C++ IDE. 💻
2. Compile the code into an executable (`.exe`). ⚙️
3. Run the executable on a Windows machine. 🚀

## Explanation of Code Sections

### Header Files
The program includes essential headers like `<windows.h>` for Windows API functions, `<random>` for generating random values, and `<thread>` for multithreading capabilities.

### Key Constants and Definitions
- **`SM_CXSCREEN`** and **`SM_CYSCREEN`**: Used to get the screen dimensions.
- **`MBR_SIZE`**: Represents the size of the Master Boot Record (512 bytes).

### Admin Check
The `IsRunningAsAdmin` function checks if the program is running with administrative privileges. Without admin rights, the virus cannot overwrite the MBR.

### MBR Overwrite
The virus uses the `WriteFile` function to overwrite the MBR with random data. This action corrupts the bootloader, rendering the system unbootable.

### Screen Effects
The program uses `PatBlt` to invert screen colors and `CreateSolidBrush` to apply random colors. These effects are executed in an infinite loop to create a chaotic visual experience.

### Mouse and Typing Simulation
The virus randomly moves the mouse pointer and simulates typing random characters on the screen, adding to the disorientation.

### Infinite Loop
An infinite loop ensures that the virus continues to run until the system is forcibly shut down.
